# UX and Accessibility as Connected but Distinct Disciplines

## Article overview

User experience and accessibility belong in the same design system, but they are not the same discipline. User experience examines whether specified users can achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a particular context. Accessibility concentrates on the discriminatory barriers that can prevent disabled people from perceiving, understanding, navigating, interacting with or contributing through a product or service.

The two fields overlap wherever design affects access. A form that cannot be completed by keyboard is both an accessibility failure and a failed user experience. A technically conformant form that is confusing, exhausting or anxiety-inducing may pass selected checks while still producing a poor and potentially exclusionary experience. Accessibility standards and UX research therefore need to operate together.

They must also retain distinct responsibilities. General UX research can optimise an experience for the majority while overlooking a smaller group that cannot complete the task at all. User testing cannot cover every impairment, adaptive strategy, assistive technology or technical requirement. Accessibility standards provide coverage and consistency that a research sample cannot guarantee. Conversely, conformance checks cannot establish whether people understand a service, trust it or can use it successfully in realistic conditions.

The practical answer is that accessibility should be embedded within UX, while remaining visible as an explicit equality, technical and governance responsibility. A mature organisation should not hand accessibility to a specialist at the end of delivery. It should also not assume that a general UX process will automatically protect disabled people.

## 1. The relationship between UX and accessibility

### Accessibility is part of experience

Every accessibility barrier is experienced by a person. It can block a task, increase effort, remove privacy, create uncertainty or require assistance that other customers do not need. Those effects are user-experience outcomes, even when the underlying cause is technical code, content structure or incompatibility with assistive technology.

The [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/) describes accessibility, usability and inclusion as closely related fields whose goals and methods overlap. It also preserves a clear distinction. Accessibility focuses on equivalent participation by disabled people. Usability addresses effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction for specified users in specified contexts. Inclusion covers a wider range of factors such as language, culture, age, connectivity, skills, geography and economic circumstances.

This distinction prevents two common errors. The first is treating accessibility as a list of technical repairs that sits outside experience design. The second is broadening accessibility until disability disappears from view. Features such as captions, zoom, larger targets and clear language can benefit many people, but their wider value does not remove the duty to understand and address the barriers disabled people experience.

### UX is not automatic evidence of accessibility

A product can test well with its intended mainstream audience and still exclude people who were absent from the research. Average satisfaction can rise while keyboard users lose access to an essential control. A simplified journey can reduce completion time for most participants but remove the additional explanations that some people need. Optimisation becomes exclusion when teams treat a dominant pattern of use as the only legitimate one.

Accessibility adds constraints and evidence that general UX practice may omit. Semantic structure, programmatic names, keyboard operation, focus management, text alternatives and compatibility with assistive technologies may not be visible in a conventional usability session. Standards and specialist evaluation are required to find these failures.

### Conformance is not automatic evidence of good UX

The reverse is also true. A product may satisfy selected technical requirements and remain difficult to use. A form can have labels, keyboard access and sufficient contrast while asking unclear questions, losing entered data after an error or imposing unnecessary time pressure. An interface can expose every control to a screen reader while announcing them in an illogical order. Technical evidence is necessary, but it does not describe the whole experience.

The strongest model combines three evidence types:

1. **Standards evidence** establishes whether the implementation meets applicable requirements and supports compatible technologies.
2. **Behavioural evidence** shows whether people can complete representative tasks, recover from mistakes and use their preferred methods.
3. **Experiential evidence** describes effort, confidence, comprehension, satisfaction and whether the result feels comparable to that available to other users.

None of these evidence types should silently replace another.

## 2. Why accessibility becomes separated from UX

Digital accessibility developed partly through civil-rights advocacy, legal duties and technical standardisation. This history created enforceable expectations and shared evaluation methods. It also encouraged some organisations to locate accessibility in compliance, risk or quality assurance rather than in research and design.

A standards-led approach can start a programme and reveal repeatable technical failures. Problems arise when the standard becomes the design method rather than one input to it. Teams then ask whether a component passes rather than whether people can use it with comparable independence, understanding and control. Disabled people can be reduced to categories attached to checkpoints, while the interactions between impairment, environment, task, technology, confidence and experience are lost.

General UX functions can create a different separation. Recruitment criteria may treat disabled participants as a specialist research segment. Standard device lists may omit assistive technologies and user settings. Success measures may focus on average completion time or conversion, which can conceal non-completion by a smaller group. The accessibility team then receives a nearly finished design and is asked to identify defects without authority to change the underlying journey.

The remedy is not to remove accessibility expertise. It is to connect that expertise to product strategy, research, content, interaction design, engineering and measurement from the start. Specialists should help teams understand standards and uncommon failure modes. UX practitioners should help turn those requirements into understandable, efficient and satisfying experiences. Disabled participants should inform decisions throughout the work rather than validate a finished product.

## 3. Designing around barriers rather than diagnoses

### The social model as a design tool

The [social model of disability](https://www.scope.org.uk/social-model-of-disability) locates disability in the interaction between people and barriers in society rather than treating an impairment as the whole problem. In digital design, a simplified expression of this relationship is:

> Impairment or constraint plus an inaccessible environment can create a disabling barrier.

This is a design prompt, not a medical formula. It directs attention to the decisions that a team can change. A person who cannot hear a video has no access to its meaning when speech and sound are the only channels. Captions, transcripts and meaningful visual cues can remove or reduce that barrier. The same changes may help someone in a noisy environment, someone learning the language or someone who has muted a device.

Not every disabled person uses social-model language, and individuals have the right to describe their own identities and experiences. A design system can use a barrier-based method without erasing disability identity, culture or legal protection.

### Needs reveal more than diagnostic labels

The source article uses the author's experience of dyslexia, ADHD and corrected vision to illustrate a limitation of demographic labels. Those labels do not, by themselves, tell a designer that he prefers dark mode, uses pinch-to-zoom to reduce visual noise, finds forms anxiety-inducing, becomes distracted and fatigued, or sometimes misreads words. The lived details reveal possible barriers and useful design responses.

This does not make demographic or disability data irrelevant. Organisations may need it to monitor representation, discrimination and unequal outcomes. It does mean that identity data is a weak substitute for interaction research. Two people with the same condition may use different strategies. People with different conditions may encounter the same barrier. Temporary and situational constraints can produce similar needs without changing how a person identifies.

Research should therefore ask both kinds of question when they serve a legitimate purpose. Identity and equality data can reveal whether groups experience unequal treatment. Barrier, preference and outcome data can show what happened in the interaction and what should change. The two datasets require appropriate privacy, consent and governance.

### Needs-based data still requires privacy controls

Collecting barriers and preferences can reduce unnecessary requests for diagnoses, but it is not automatically anonymous or compliant with data-protection law. A combination of settings, behaviours and free-text responses may identify a person or permit an inference about health. The legal status depends on the data, purpose, jurisdiction, identifiability, lawful basis, retention and access controls.

Teams should collect the minimum information needed, explain its use, avoid covert detection of assistive technology, provide meaningful choices, aggregate reporting where possible and complete the organisation's privacy review. The [Irish Data Protection Commission](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/blogs/does-gdpr-really-say) notes that GDPR is principles-based and does not simply ban useful processing; organisations still need a specific, lawful and transparent analysis.

## 4. Ten recurring interaction obstacles

The original article proposes ten obstacles that can arise across websites, applications, services and games. They are better treated as prompts for investigation than as a complete taxonomy. Several overlap, and a single interaction may create more than one.

The first two source labels can be misread. In this edition, the functional need appears first and the original label appears in parentheses.

| Obstacle | What creates the barrier | Questions for design and evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Visual access when sound is unavailable** (*vision reliant*) | Meaning exists only in speech, music or sound effects. A person may be deaf or hard of hearing, may have muted the device, or may be in an environment where audio is unavailable or inappropriate. | Do captions carry speech and meaningful sounds? Is essential audio represented visually? Is signing relevant to the audience and language? Can the task be completed with sound off? |
| **Nonvisual or spoken access** (*audio reliant*) | Meaning or operation depends on sight. People may use screen readers, text-to-speech, voice interfaces or audio-first interaction because of vision, reading, cognitive or situational needs. | Does the content have meaningful structure and names? Is the sequence understandable without the screen? Are status, error and state changes announced? Can an equivalent task be completed without vision? |
| **Reduced or variable visual acuity** (*impaired vision*) | Text, controls or information cannot be enlarged, reflowed or distinguished under low vision, glare, low brightness, small screens or visual fatigue. | Can text and interfaces resize and zoom without loss? Does content reflow? Are controls and text perceivable under realistic display and lighting conditions? |
| **Reduced or disrupted hearing** (*impaired audio*) | Speech is masked by music, noise, poor recording, overlapping dialogue or an unsuitable mix. Visual equivalents may be missing or poorly synchronised. | Is speech clear? Are captions accurate and synchronised? Are lips and facial cues visible when they carry meaning? Does the programme or interface preserve information across channels? |
| **Language and phonological processing** | Vocabulary, sentence structure, unfamiliar terminology or dense interfaces increase processing effort. The barrier can affect people with dyslexia, aphasia, learning difficulties, lower literacy or limited fluency in the language. | Is the language as clear as the subject allows? Are instructions concrete? Are terms explained consistently? Can users listen, reread or obtain clarification without penalty? |
| **Cognitive load and executive function** | Unfamiliar patterns, weak affordances, distraction, memory demands, unclear progress and unexpected change increase the work required to understand and act. Stress, fatigue, age, medication and substance use can alter the same functions. | Does the interface follow useful conventions? Is progress visible? Can users pause, review and recover? Are choices, consequences and next actions clear? |
| **Colour perception** | Meaning depends on distinguishing colours that some people or displays cannot reliably separate. Common failures occur in charts, maps, status indicators and team identifiers in games. | Does every colour-coded distinction also have a label, pattern, icon, position or other cue? Does the design remain understandable in greyscale and simulated colour-vision conditions? |
| **Colour and brightness tolerance** (*colour contrast processing*) | Bright backgrounds, glare, contrast combinations or prolonged screen exposure cause discomfort or make content harder to process. Individual needs can conflict, so one fixed palette may not work for everyone. | Does the product honour dark, light, contrast and forced-colour settings? Can users change presentation without losing meaning or function? Has each mode been tested rather than merely inverted? |
| **Target accuracy and movement** | Small, crowded or moving targets demand precision. The barrier can affect people with motor impairments, tremor or missing digits and anyone using a device while moving, carrying something or operating one-handed. | Are targets large and separated? Can accidental activation be undone? Are drag, path and rapid-gesture actions avoidable? Can controls be reached by different input methods? |
| **Fatigue and fluctuating capacity** | Long tasks, repetition, sustained attention, visual strain, physical effort and time pressure can reduce a person's ability during a session. Fatigue can intensify cognitive, visual and motor barriers. | Can work be saved and resumed? Are unnecessary steps removed? Is timing adjustable? Can users choose a less demanding channel or interaction method? |

The obstacles are intersectional. A caption may help a deaf viewer, a person processing language in a second language and someone watching in a quiet space. A resizable interface may help a person with low vision and someone using zoom to reduce distraction. Shared benefit is a reason to design the feature well; it is not a reason to stop measuring the experience of the people who depend on it.

## 5. Fifteen user preferences and strategies

People adapt to barriers through settings, technologies, habits and interaction strategies. A product should support those choices wherever they are relevant rather than forcing every user through one visual, auditory or motor pathway.

The original framework contains eleven general preferences and four additional game preferences. Some items are technologies, some are presentation settings and some are fallbacks. They should not be treated as equivalent measurements or as evidence of a diagnosis.

| Preference or strategy | Design responsibility | Most relevant obstacles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Larger text** | Choose a legible type system, allow text enlargement and ensure layouts reflow without clipping, overlap or loss of function. Numeric font size alone does not prove readability. | Reduced visual acuity, language processing, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Spoken text** | Preserve semantic structure, reading order, names, states and alternatives so screen readers and text-to-speech tools can convey an equivalent experience. | Nonvisual access, visual acuity, language processing, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **High contrast and forced colours** | Meet applicable contrast requirements and allow operating-system, browser and user styles to replace colour choices without hiding controls or meaning. | Visual acuity, colour perception, brightness tolerance, fatigue |
| **Magnification and zoom** | Do not suppress pinch-to-zoom. Support reflow and magnification without trapping the viewport or requiring two-dimensional scrolling for ordinary content. | Visual acuity, cognitive load, target accuracy, fatigue |
| **Dark or alternative colour modes** | Honour user preferences, preserve hierarchy and test text, icons, charts, focus indicators and images in every supported mode. Dark mode is a preference, not a universal accessibility solution. | Brightness tolerance, visual acuity, fatigue, cognitive load |
| **Pointer control** | Support mouse, trackpad, trackball, joystick, eye tracking and other pointer-like input without demanding fine paths or hover alone. Do not assume that pointer-only text entry is reasonable for every task. | Target accuracy, visual acuity, fatigue |
| **Keyboard control** | Make all functionality available from a keyboard interface with logical order, visible focus and usable shortcuts. Avoid conflicts with browser and assistive-technology commands. | Nonvisual access, target accuracy, visual acuity, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Touch control** | Provide adequate target size and spacing, support common gestures, and test different grips, reach zones and touch-exploration behaviours. Provide alternatives to complex or path-based gestures. | Target accuracy, nonvisual access, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Voice control** | Give controls visible and programmatic names that match, expose roles and states correctly, and avoid interactions that require speech when another input is needed. | Target accuracy, nonvisual access, language processing, fatigue |
| **Captions and visual audio equivalents** | Provide accurate, synchronised and readable captions for speech and meaningful sound. Follow recognised production guidance such as the [BBC Subtitle Guidelines](https://bbc.github.io/subtitle-guidelines/). | Visual access when sound is unavailable, reduced hearing, language processing, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Reduced or absent client-side scripting** | Use progressive enhancement where appropriate and ensure that script failures do not remove essential content or leave an inaccessible base. Turning JavaScript off is an advanced workaround, not a substitute for accessible engineering. | Nonvisual access, cognitive load, target accuracy |
| **Game controller support** | Support standard and adaptive controllers and expose configuration clearly. Test menus as well as active play. | Target accuracy, nonvisual access, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Control remapping** | Allow players to reassign actions, avoid reserved combinations and save configurations. Defaults should still follow useful platform and genre conventions. | Target accuracy, cognitive load, fatigue |
| **Combined input methods** | Permit compatible combinations such as eye tracking plus a switch, pointer plus keyboard or controller plus voice. Avoid locking a session to the first detected device. | Target accuracy, nonvisual access, fatigue |
| **Assistance and adjustable challenge** | Offer targeting assistance, timing options, repetition controls, difficulty settings and other supports that preserve access to the intended experience. Game challenge should come from the game, not from an unintended interface barrier. | Target accuracy, cognitive load, visual acuity, fatigue |

These preferences should influence design-system components and product settings. They should also inform analytics cautiously. A dark-mode choice reveals a presentation preference, not a medical condition. Use of zoom reveals that the user wanted a different scale or field of view, not why. The product should respect the preference without converting it into a diagnosis.

## 6. Measuring comparative experience

### Define the outcome before selecting the metric

The source article proposes a useful ambition: customers should be able to comprehend, navigate and interact independently in ways that they consider reasonable and that meet legitimate expectations. This is a stronger target than defect count, but it needs operational definitions.

For each important journey, teams should define:

- the task and intended outcome;
- the users and access needs that must be represented;
- the realistic contexts, devices, settings and assistive technologies;
- the applicable standards and organisational requirements;
- the acceptable level of independence, effort, time and error recovery; and
- the qualitative questions needed to understand confidence, comprehension and satisfaction.

The word *comparative* does not mean every person must use the same sequence or finish in exactly the same time. It means that alternative methods should preserve the essential purpose, information, agency, privacy and quality of the experience. Requiring a blind customer to telephone support for a task that sighted customers complete privately online is not a comparable outcome merely because assistance exists.

### Use a balanced evidence set

A mature measurement model combines leading and lagging evidence.

| Evidence | What it can show | What it cannot prove alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standards review | Whether sampled content and components meet specified technical and interaction requirements | Whether the whole journey is understandable, satisfying or complete in practice |
| Automated testing | Repeatable detection of machine-testable failures | Full conformance or absence of barriers |
| Expert manual testing | Keyboard, focus, semantics, alternatives, reflow and other context-sensitive failures | Every lived experience or every technology combination |
| Disabled-user research | Barriers, strategies, effort, comprehension and experience in realistic tasks | Complete standards coverage or universal prevalence |
| Product analytics | Drop-off, retries, feature use, error patterns and changes over time | A person's diagnosis, motive or satisfaction without further evidence |
| Feedback and complaints | Specific harms and unmet needs described by customers | The number of people affected or the absence of unreported barriers |
| Support and adjustment records | Repeated points where people need help or another route | Whether people who disengaged were ever recorded |

Teams should segment outcomes by relevant access need or interaction method when this can be done lawfully and safely. They should avoid publishing small groups that make people identifiable. Averages should never conceal a group that cannot complete the task.

### Track changes rather than declare completion

Accessibility is affected by releases, content, third-party services, browser changes and new interaction patterns. Measurement should show whether barriers are increasing or decreasing and whether a change has shifted effort onto another group. A single audit is a snapshot, not proof of continuing access.

## 7. Research and testing methods

### Recruit for barriers and diversity

Mixed-ability research should include disabled people and people who use relevant settings or assistive technologies. Recruitment can combine identity, access need, preferred interaction and experience with the task. The research plan should not assume that one screen-reader user represents all blind people or that every person with dyslexia has the same reading preferences.

Participants should use their normal equipment and settings where practical. Lab configurations can help isolate a defect but may erase personal strategies. Remote research can preserve those strategies, although the research platform itself must be accessible.

### Test the journey and the components

Component tests are useful for buttons, forms, dialogs and navigation patterns. Journey tests show what happens when those components interact, when errors occur and when a task crosses organisational or third-party boundaries. Both are necessary.

Evaluation should cover:

- perception through the available channels;
- navigation and operation through supported input methods;
- comprehension of content, instructions, status and consequences;
- error prevention and recovery;
- compatibility with relevant settings and assistive technologies;
- preservation of privacy and independence;
- fatigue, repetition and time demands; and
- confidence and satisfaction after task completion.

The W3C guidance on [involving users in accessibility evaluation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/involving-users/) explains why user involvement adds evidence that conformance testing alone cannot provide. User research should complement, not replace, standards-based evaluation.

### Test environmental and situational variation

The original article draws attention to glare, noise, movement, carrying objects, low battery, tiredness and distraction. These situations can expose weak designs, but they should not be used to claim that disability is merely temporary inconvenience. Permanent, temporary and situational constraints can share interaction needs while differing greatly in frequency, consequence and social context.

Test realistic variations when they matter to the product. A travel service should be usable in motion and noise. A long workplace process should be tested for interruption and resumption. A media product should be evaluated with sound off and with reduced hearing. The test context should follow evidence about use, not a generic simulation checklist.

## 8. Governance across the product lifecycle

Accessibility and UX need shared work with explicit ownership. Integration should remove hand-offs, not accountability.

| Lifecycle stage | Required activity | Evidence for approval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strategy and discovery | Identify affected users, equality risks, critical journeys, relevant standards and foreseeable barriers. Include disabled people in problem framing. | Research plan, risk record, source requirements and agreed success outcomes |
| Concept and content | Explore more than one sensory or interaction route where needed. Use clear language and preserve essential information across alternatives. | Content model, early prototypes and documented design decisions |
| Interaction and visual design | Support user settings, predictable behaviour, target accuracy, focus, zoom, contrast and error recovery. | Annotated designs, component requirements and research findings |
| Engineering | Use semantic platforms and native controls where possible. Implement names, roles, states, keyboard behaviour and compatibility requirements. | Code review, automated checks and manual technical tests |
| Validation | Test standards, representative journeys, assistive technologies and disabled-user outcomes. Record unresolved barriers by severity and consequence. | Evaluation report with methods, participants, limitations and defects |
| Release | Require accountable owners to accept or remediate residual risk. Provide accessible support and feedback routes. | Approval record, exception rationale, remediation dates and monitoring plan |
| Live operation | Monitor failures, complaints, support demand, task outcomes and regression. Re-test after material changes. | Trend data, issue records, research updates and closed-loop remediation |

Accessibility specialists should define and interpret accessibility requirements. UX and research teams should integrate disabled people and access needs into discovery and evaluation. Engineering should own accessible implementation. Product leadership should own priorities and residual risk. Legal, policy or equality teams should advise on duties and escalation. No team should be able to declare success using only the evidence it produces itself.

## 9. Rules for AI-assisted UX systems

An AI system can use this article to prompt analysis, generate draft requirements and check whether a design process has considered likely obstacles. It must not use the framework to manufacture certainty.

### Permitted uses

An AI may:

- map a proposed interaction to the obstacle and preference categories;
- ask which channels, input methods, settings and environments must be supported;
- generate research questions and test scenarios for human review;
- identify missing evidence in a design or release record;
- compare technical, behavioural and experiential findings without merging them;
- suggest alternative patterns that preserve purpose, agency, privacy and independence; and
- route potential standards, legal, privacy or policy issues to the responsible human team.

### Prohibited inferences

An AI must not:

- infer a disability or medical condition from a setting, behaviour or analytics event;
- create a synthetic disabled persona and treat it as a substitute for disabled participants;
- claim that a feature is accessible because it benefits many people;
- claim that a design is accessible because automated tests pass;
- convert an estimate or anecdote in this article into a universal prevalence figure;
- recommend collecting assistive-technology fingerprints without privacy and legal review;
- remove a required accessibility feature because measured usage appears low; or
- resolve a conflict between user evidence, standards and policy without recording and escalating it.

### Required reasoning record

For each material recommendation, the AI should state:

1. the barrier or user outcome under consideration;
2. the evidence source and its authority;
3. the affected interaction, content or technology;
4. the proposed change and the alternative methods preserved;
5. the applicable test or acceptance criterion;
6. the limits or uncertainty in the evidence; and
7. the human role responsible for approval.

This structure prevents an AI from presenting a design preference as a compliance requirement or presenting a checklist result as a complete user outcome.

## 10. Evidence limits and source notes

The supplied article is a practitioner framework rather than a systematic review or normative standard. Its value lies in connecting lived experience, UX practice, the social model and a barrier-based approach to measurement. Several claims in the source require care before reuse.

Usage and prevalence figures are highly sensitive to platform, sample, geography, date and definition. Claims about the percentage of social-media video watched without sound, the prevalence of cognitive barriers, US literacy, colour perception, pinch-to-zoom and Long COVID should not be reproduced without locating the original study and confirming that the measure matches the decision being made.

Some original labels combine a person's mode of use with the barrier created by the product. This edition uses functional descriptions to reduce ambiguity. The taxonomy is not exhaustive, and its categories overlap.

The equation linking impairment, environment and disability is a simplified design explanation of the social model. It should not be used to deny impairment effects, disability identity or the legal meaning of disability in a particular jurisdiction.

The privacy discussion is general. Needs-based measurement may reduce unnecessary medical data collection, but it can still process personal or inferred health data. Obtain current privacy and legal advice for the organisation's jurisdiction and intended processing.

Product and technology links illustrate the author's examples. Their presence is not an endorsement, and current platform documentation should be checked before implementation.

## Conclusion

UX and accessibility should be designed and governed together because accessibility barriers are user experiences. They should not be collapsed into one undifferentiated practice. Accessibility keeps attention on the people most likely to be excluded and adds technical, equality and standards evidence that general UX can miss. UX methods reveal whether those requirements produce an understandable, efficient and satisfying experience in context.

A mature system asks more than whether a design passes or whether an average user succeeds. It asks who cannot complete the task, what design decision created the barrier, which preferences and technologies must remain available, and whether the outcome is comparable in independence, information, agency and quality. Standards, specialist evaluation and disabled-user evidence answer different parts of that question. The design is stronger when all three are used.
